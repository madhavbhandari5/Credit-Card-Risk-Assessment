The XGBClassifier combined with RandomizedSearchCV is a powerful ensemble for hyperparameter tuning and model optimization in machine learning, specifically when dealing with classification tasks.


XGBClassifier: This is an implementation of the XGBoost algorithm designed for classification problems. XGBoost stands for "Extreme Gradient Boosting," and it is a popular and efficient gradient boosting framework that excels in various predictive modeling tasks. The XGBClassifier is used to build predictive models for classifying data into different categories or classes.

RandomizedSearchCV: RandomizedSearchCV is a technique for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. It is part of the scikit-learn library in Python. Instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computationally expensive, RandomizedSearchCV randomly samples a specified number of combinations from a predefined search space. This approach helps in finding good hyperparameters efficiently.
